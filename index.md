### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was fun because it was where it all started for me. I learned about the very basics of using GitHub. This lab is the base for everything I have done in this class.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 was a funny one because I spent a lot of time on this one with my partner after class, even though the code wasn't the hardest. We couldn't figure out what went wrong with the code. It turns out that the text we were outputting was just wrong. This taught me to really read the directions carefully.

* Lab 7

    The end of lab 2, part 2, was really hard. My partner was really good at coding because he had done it before. He was nice enough to teach me after we finished. He basically taught me all about functions.
