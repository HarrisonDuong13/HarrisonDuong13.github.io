### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    I liked lab 1 because it was where it all started for me. I learned about the very basics of using GitHub. This lab is the base for everything I have done in this class.

* Lab 5

    I liked lab 5 because I spent a lot of time on this one with my partner after class, even though the code wasn't the hardest. We couldn't figure out what went wrong with the code. It turns out that the text we were outputting was just wrong. I learned to read the directions carefully.

* Lab 7

    I liked the end of lab 2, part 2, because it was really hard. My partner was really good at coding because he had done it before. He was nice enough to teach me after we finished. I learned all about functions.
